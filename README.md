# üß• TinyVGG on FashionMNIST using PyTorch

This project implements a convolutional neural network using a simplified VGG-style architecture (TinyVGG) in PyTorch to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. It also visualizes the intermediate feature maps to better understand what the network learns.
